\arguments{
\item{innerTemp0}{Numerical vector containing the temperature (in Celsius) inside the greenhouse at the moment of switching on the climatic systems.}

\item{innerTempF}{Numerical vector containing the temperature (in Celsius) inside the greenhouse at the moment of switching off the climatic systems.}

\item{innerHum0}{Numerical vector containing the relative humidity (percentage) inside the greenhouse at the moment of switching on the climatic systems.}

\item{extTemp0}{Numerical vector containing the temperature (in Celsius) outside the greenhouse at the moment of switching on the climatic systems.}

\item{extTempF}{Numerical vector containing the temperature (in Celsius) outside the greenhouse at the moment of switching off the climatic systems.}

\item{extHum0}{Numerical vector containing the relative humidity (percentage) outside the greenhouse at the moment of switching on the climatic systems.}

\item{extHumF}{Numerical vector containing the relative humidity (percentage) outside the greenhouse at the moment of switching off the climatic systems.}

\item{extRad0}{Numerical vector containing the radiation (in W/m^2) outside the greenhouse at the moment of switching on the climatic systems.}

\item{extRadF}{Numerical vector containing the radiation (in W/m^2) outside the greenhouse at the moment of switching off the climatic systems.}

\item{secondsON}{Numerical vector containing the switch-on times of the climatic systems in seconds.}
}
\value{
Logical: TRUE if the target temperature is reached and FALSE if not, and Numeric: indicating the final humidity inside the greenhouse.
}
\description{
Prediction of reaching the target temperature inside the greenhouse, taking into account the different parameters, when the 3 fans and the recirculators are on at a given time.
